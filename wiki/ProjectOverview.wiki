#summary Project Overview

===Welcome to the svg2vml project site! ===

SVG2VML is a lightweight JavaScript library that makes it easy to include vector graphics in web pages by providing a common SVG-style programming interface to VML and SVG. This project is a work in progress, and suggestions and contributions are welcome.

You can download the library in the downloads section.
