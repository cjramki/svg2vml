===Welcome to the svg2vml project site! ===

SVG2VML is a lightweight JavaScript library that makes it easy to include vector graphics in web pages by providing a common SVG-style programming interface to VML and SVG. This project is a work in progress, and suggestions and contributions are welcome.

You can view the ProjectRoadmap to see upcoming changes we have planned.

See the SampleCode page for examples of use.

If you have comments, suggestions, or questions you can email me at lorien.henrywilkins@gmail.com.
